  Coffee is grown all over the world. But you'll never believe where I found the
  orange cocoa bean that brews the most expensive coffee in the world!

FJ Ministries was born out of a vision God laid on the hearts of Bryan and Tara Riley.  Our Mission of F.A.I.T.H. is “Families reaching families as Avenues to the Nations, Igniting passion for God and compassion for people, Teaching and training God’s Word and character with Hearts and hands revealed.”  We long to live by faith in all that we do.  Colossians 2:6.  We hope God will enable us to reach families and show them that they too can participate in the Great Commission.  May our heart’s passion be for God and for serving others and in so doing encourage others to the same passion.



FJ were the two letters God gave us individually on July 26, 2006, in Kona, Hawaii, as we prayed over what our ministry should be and had memories flood our hearts in prayer.  For Tara, FJ was “for Jim.”  Jim was a friend of Tara’s during her teenage years who had a heart for God and missions.  He had gone to Haiti as a young teenager and wanted to see that ministry furthered.  Unfortunately, for reasons only God truly knows, Jim decided to end his life.  In the wake of the grief over that loss, Tara told God that she wanted to do whatever it was God had planned “for Jim” to do.  As we prayed together about what our ministry was to be, God reminded her of that promise.
